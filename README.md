## Overview  

minervaOS is the first fully blockchain-integrated operating system, designed to streamline interaction with the Solana ecosystem. Built for degens, traders, and developers, it provides tools for real-time trading, node management, security enhancements, and on-chain data analytics—all through a minimal, terminal-inspired interface.
