- @maxux


## Progress update


### Flist manipulation (maxux)

Little set back cause by some problem implementing put and putdir commands.

### Network setup of the new dev farm (delandtj)

- Creation of a new monitoring system (we were kinda blind so far)
- New router is nearly ready, hardware is ok, still need to do some cabling and software config
  - update planned for tonight
- We take that knowledge gathered during this exercise to write down documentation for farmer that would want to provide exit nodes.

### 0-os Networking (zaibon/delandtj)

- Zaibon started extracting logic about network creation out of tnodb and move it into a library (https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/issues/124)

- Created a crypto package to be able to encrypt the private key of the wireguard config into a TNO (https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/issues/116)

### Building pipeline

- Maxux implemented the incremental building of the kernel. Now commit on zosv2 repo will only trigger the building of the modules and not the full kernel.
