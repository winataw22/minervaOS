### Progress update

#### [Update procedure](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/pull/208)

Specification have progressed, we discussed them during meeting everyone agreed, we're moving on with the implementation of the POC.

#### [0-db provisioning](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/issues/144)

0-db provisioning PR has been merged. We can now reserve 0-db namespace, Yeah !

#### [Network]

@delandtj has started to write specification how we're going to solve the routing problem for the exit point : https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/blob/7510a901e1df3f47e30f6906fb519a0319aa5884/specs/network/Gateway_Container.md

His solution allow to only have to configure 16 routes on the upstream router of the farmer. 
The rest of the routing will be done by the exit node themself.

@zaibon started implementing this routing logic in networkd, still in progress.

#### [Testing](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/issues/195)

@maxux has started getting fluent with zosv2 tooling. Still need to work on logs forwarding and write down the test scripts.

### New feature proposal

@zaibon has open an issue about an idea he had to help the debugging of 0-OS node in production: https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/issues/205
