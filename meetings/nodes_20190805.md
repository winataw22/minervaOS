## Progress update

### [implement veth pair creation per container and connect to NR bridge](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/issues/147) (@azmy):

Basic scaffolding of the code is there. Some question regarding how to generate veth pair name has been discussed during meeting.
Still need to figure out an issue we get during creating of the veth pair itself.

### [Implement 0-db provisioning](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/issues/144) (@zaibon)

Storage logic has been implemented. 0-OS can now allocate space on disk for 0-db usage.
@Zaibon will wait on the veth pair creation task to be done to continue working on this since the networking
part for this task is nearly identical as the one for normal container

### [Convert specs document into documentation](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/issues/102)

We have 2 modules fully documented:

- flist
- storage

We already already late by one, networking, but this should be fixed today.
