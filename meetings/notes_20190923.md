## progress Update

### Upgrade refactor (@muhamadazmy)

Mostly code complete. Upgradectl is also being updated to support the new flist management required when a new release is created.

### Testing (@maxux)

Testing is going on. Already found some bugs. 

Tooling will be improved to be able to check provision results.

### Network (@zaibon)

Refactoring of the network has started. But specs are still not clear and seems to be not final just yet.
A bit of confusion here, needs to be clarified.
