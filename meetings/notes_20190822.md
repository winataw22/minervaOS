### [0-db provisioning](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/issues/144)

PR open open: https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/pull/196

### Github actions

We got access to the beta of github actions ! Yeah ! 
CI workflow has been added, we'll play with it for a while and if everything behave good we can get rid of travis-ci

### [Listen port for wireguard](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/issues/183)

This issue has been resolved. We finally realized we can also do that deterministic. 
Which makes the problem non-existent at all. Super happy about this.
This actually lead the creation of another issue: https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/issues/192

### [Security enhancement for daemons](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/issues/79)

@muhamadazmy has done some preliminary research regarding how to remove capabilities from processes.

### [upgraded and lifetime procedures](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/issues/170)

During the meeting we discussed the latest proposal from @muhamadazmy about this. It seems his idea 
has some potential and we'll investigate that direction.

### 0-FS corruepted cache issue

@muhamadazmy propose a solution to the 0-fs cache corruption problem. An issue is going to be open about it.

### [IPv4 in container](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/issues/184)

@delandtj found a solution for it, determinictic again.
Specs is going to be written and implementation should follow short after.

### Flist

Final implementation of flist are done, early documentation is written and tests were made.
The tool is currently being ported to Jumpscale. For now, all good.

### Stress Test

Prepraring stress test of the nodes about provisioning with some test by @maxux.
I'll figure out how all works and try to make testing scripts using documentation provided.
