### Progress update


### [IPv4 in container](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/issues/184)

@delandtj found a solution for it, determinictic again.
Specs is going to be written and implementation should follow short after.

### Split networkd 

[https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/pull/236](preliminary PR)

Maybe instead of @azmy's solution to have an udhcpc running on all interfaces 
in order to get an ip so that an flist can be downloaded, it could be better
to have the bootstrap code in networkd split up for initialization.
That way, we can also later have the same type of code for nodes like in v1
to specify on kernel cmdline which interfaces to take into account for
bootstrapping.
Also, we could have the for farmers added things for single-iface nodes
to be able to differentiate public/private through means of vlans.

### Upgrade and boot from flists
@azmy has PR ready to get system booted (after initial setup of storage and network)
from an flist, so that we can have upgraded get the new flist and restart the daemons.  

### gedis/bcdb stuff
@maxux is looking into it (or fighting)
