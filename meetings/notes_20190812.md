## Progress update

### [Provisioning](https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/issues/121)

- PR regarding decommissioning of the workload has been open. Waiting for review.

- 0-db provisioning https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/issues/176: Port management package has been created but the task is in pause now cause we still need to figure out how we're going to manage the networking part (how to expose the 0-db publicly)

### Network

- Container IP management PR has been merged. Container now gets a IPv6 address in the prefix of their network when they starts.

- We still need to give IPv4 address: https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/issues/184

- disabling of ipv6 on all bridges and veth pairs is done: https://github.com/threefoldtech/zosv2/pull/181

- @delandtj has investigated https://devguard.io/. Seems we could learn from it for the future.

### Flist manipulation

Nearly code complete, only missing feature is merging of 2 flists.
